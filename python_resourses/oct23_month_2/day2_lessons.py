# Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number. e.g. if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8
# Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any two-digit number.

two_digit_number = input() # 3, 5
print(int(two_digit_number[0]) + (int(two_digit_number[1])))
# = 8
